                    neurons and muscle cells generate voltage differences
                    that can be detected. I constructed a simple EMG circuit
                    capable of detecting these voltage differences as well
                    as applying successive filtering to generate a cleanly
                    rectified voltage signal on an Oscilloscope. Using this
                    voltage, I also wrote a short Arduino script to
                    control a servo motor that rotated in proportion
                    to the degree of muscle contraction my forearm
                    engaged in as measured by the voltage level.

                    that prevents a patient from sufficiently dorsiflexing
                    their foot when walking. In an attempt to treat this
                    disorder I constructed a device that delivered pulses
                    of electricity to the tibialis anterior muscle to
                    actively stimulate motor contraction and lift the
                    foot. This device was able to measure, by way of
                    a pressure sensor placed on the heel and an arduino,
                    when a person was about to initiate a gait cycle and
                    thus could actively sense when to apply electrical
                    stimulation and when not to.

                    A Photoplethysmograph is a device that
                    measures changes in blood volume in
                    the vasculature to determine vitals such
                    as heart rate. Using Matlab code, I built
                    a very simple script capable of determine
                    a person’s heart rate based on a video
                    obtained through a smart phones camera
                    and flash. The script measured changes
                    in the pixel intensity caused by variations
                    in blood volume in the finger, filtered
                    the signal, and detected the peaks in
                    the waveform to calculate the heart rate.

                    Medical, Inc.
                    I was responsible for finding and evaluating clinical research on new and existing medical devices
                    as well as
                    creating profiles for medical devices to be used by hospital Value Analysis Committees in their
                    process of evaluating
                    requested medical devices. On top of these responsibilities, I also developed a few pieces of Python
                    code that increased the efficiency and speed of GreenLight Medical’s workflow.
                    The functionality of some of the scripts I wrote include the following:

                        </li>
