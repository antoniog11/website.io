        </h2>
        <p class="lead">
            <p>Cancer cell resistance poses a particularly significant challenge for the treatment of cancer.Multiple factors are involved in the conferral of drug resistance to a growing tumor. Many changes occur within a cancer cell that confer upon them resistance including altered metabolism, decreased drug uptake, increased drug efflux, and alterations in membrane receptors (e.g. Androgen receptors). The effect of a heterogenous tumor microenvironment is also involved in this drug resistant property exhibited by cancer cells. In this study, I formulated and planned a thorough research project that evaluated how cancer cell spheroids responded to Docetaxel, Cabazitaxel, and TRAIL in an effort to see how fibroblasts conferred drug resistance to cancer cells. During this 3 month long project, I independently:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Produced 3D spheroid co-cultures</li>
  <li>Treated the spheroid co-cultures with Docetaxel, Cabazitaxel , and TRAIL</li>
  <li>Imaged the spheroids using fluorescence and brightfield microscopy (see picture)</li>
  <li>Analyzed the spheroids using imageJ software</li>
  <li>Performed and analyzed flow cytometric data on the spheroids</li>
</ul>

        <p class="lead">
            <p>Prostate Cancer metastasis remains a leading cause of cancer related death in men and
thus methods to prevent the spread of cancer would drastically improve patient survival. During the year that I worked on this project, I was responsible for testing how efficient TRAIL (TNF Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand) conjugated nanoparticles were in killing Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) in the blood of cancer patients. My roles during this project included separating CTCs from patient blood samples, treating patient blood samples with the TRAIL protein in a viscometer, counting and taking fluorescent microscope pictures of the treated blood samples, and analyzing the fraction of dead and alive cancer cells. This project introduced me to the world of cancer research and academic research as a whole. I learned extensive cell biology, cell culture techniques, fluorescence microscopy, and developed a significant understanding of cancer biology.</p>
