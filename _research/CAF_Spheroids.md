Cancer cell resistance poses a particularly significant challenge for the treatment of cancer.Multiple factors are involved in the conferral of drug resistance to a growing tumor. Many changes occur within a cancer cell that confer upon them resistance including altered metabolism, decreased drug uptake, increased drug efflux, and alterations in membrane receptors (e.g. Androgen receptors). The effect of a heterogenous tumor microenvironment is also involved in this drug resistant property exhibited by cancer cells. In this study, I formulated and planned a thorough research project that evaluated how cancer cell spheroids responded to Docetaxel, Cabazitaxel, and TRAIL in an effort to see how fibroblasts conferred drug resistance to cancer cells. During this 3 month long project, I independently:
- Produced 3D spheroid co-cultures
- Treated the spheroid co-cultures with Docetaxel, Cabazitaxel , and TRAIL
- Imaged the spheroids using fluorescence and brightfield microscopy (see picture)
- Analyzed the spheroids using imageJ software
- Performed and analyzed flow cytometric data on the spheroids
