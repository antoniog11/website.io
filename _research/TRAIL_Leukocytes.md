Prostate Cancer metastasis remains a leading cause of cancer related death in men and
thus methods to prevent the spread of cancer would drastically improve patient survival. During the year that I worked on this project, I was responsible for testing how efficient TRAIL (TNF Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand) conjugated nanoparticles were in killing Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) in the blood of cancer patients. My roles during this project included separating CTCs from patient blood samples, treating patient blood samples with the TRAIL protein in a viscometer, counting and taking fluorescent microscope pictures of the treated blood samples, and analyzing the fraction of dead and alive cancer cells. This project introduced me to the world of cancer research and academic research as a whole. I learned extensive cell biology, cell culture techniques, fluorescence microscopy, and developed a significant understanding of cancer biology.
