                            as applying successive filtering to generate a cleanly
                            rectified voltage signal on an Oscilloscope. Using this
                            voltage, I also wrote a short Arduino script to
                            control a servo motor that rotated in proportion

                                    foot. This device was able to measure, by way of 
                                    a pressure sensor placed on the heel and an arduino,
                                    when a person was about to initiate a gait cycle and

                                    in blood volume in the finger, filtered 
                                    the signal, and detected the peaks in 
                                    the waveform to calculate the heart rate.

                                     the treated blood samples, and analyzing the fraction of dead and alive cancer cells. This
                                      project introduced me to the world of cancer research and academic research as a whole. I
                                      learned extensive cell biology, cell culture techniques, fluorescence microscopy, and developed 
                                      a significant understanding of cancer biology that I will carry with me into my future as a 
                                      potential medical researcher or physician scientist.

                                    Cancer cell resistance poses a particularly significant challenge for the treatment of cancer.
                                     Multiple factors are involved in the conferral of drug resistance to a growing tumor. Many 
                                     changes occur within a cancer cell that confer upon them resistance including altered metabolism, 
                                     decreased drug uptake, increased drug efflux, and alterations in membrane receptors (e.g. Androgen
                                      receptors). The effect of a heterogenous tumor microenvironment is also involved in this drug 
                                      resistant property exhibited by cancer cells. In this study, I formulated and planned a thorough 
                                      research project that evaluated how cancer cell spheroids responded to Docetaxel, Cabazitaxel , 
                                      and TRAIL in an effort to see how fibroblasts conferred drug resistance to cancer cells. During 
                                      this 3 month long project, I independently:
